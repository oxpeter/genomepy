This directory is used to store the config files generated by the
 config module. You can either allow python to construct them, 
or write it yourself.

The format is <variable> whitespace <path>. Eg:
lclgff /home/antqueen/genomes/armyant.OGS.1.8.7_lcl.gff

Ensure that each new variable is on a new line.

for an up-to-date list of variables to include in the 
pathways.cfg file, see the doc-string for the config module.
