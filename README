This is a set of python modules that allows analysis of local genome data for use with microsatellite analysis, PCR creation or CRISPR analysis. A few tools also have been added which allow interaction with some of NCBI's web tools.

Prerequisites:
A fairly large number of other programs are needed for the full suite to work:
pysam
argparse
samtools
gsnap
pysamstats
biopython
if you're not using genematch or crispralign, then you may be able to get away 
with not also installing these modules.


INSTALLATION:
As of version 1.0, it should be possible to use the following for installation:

python setup.py install
